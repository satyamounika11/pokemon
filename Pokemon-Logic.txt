LOGIC:
Whole Pokemon Dataset is assigned to the variable name = "pokemonList"

1) Displaying Information of the Pokemon by taking the pokemon's name as the argument:

	a) Created a function naming "PokemonData" and provided parameters "name" and "pokemonList".

	b) Created a variable "pokemonName" and assigned to false. If the "pokemonName" is true, then the data related
	   to the pokemon will be displayed. As of now, its empty.

	c) Created a variable "name" so that whatever the pokemon name is given, it will consider as an argument which
	   will be taken from window.prompt.

	d) Providing a "for" condition where it iterates the data related to pokemon in the pokemonList.

	e) If condition holds the logic, which compares if the given argument "name" is present in the pokemon list.
	   If TRUE, it provides the pokemon related data. i.e. name, image, type,height, weight, candy, candy_count,
	   eggs, spawn chance, average spawns and spawns time.

	f) Provided another if condition to provide a message when the given name is not found in pokemonList.

2) Find pokemons that have the given name in the “next_evolution” field:

	a) Created a function naming "nextEvolution" and provided parameters "evolutionName" and "pokemonList".

	b) Created a variable "pokemonEvolutionName" and assigned to false. If the "pokemonEvolutionName" is true, then
	   the pokemon having the given name in the "next_evolution" field will be displayed. As of now, its empty.

	c) Created a variable "evolutionName" so that whatever the pokemon name is given, it will consider as an argument
	   which will be taken from window.prompt.

	d) Providing a "for" condition where it iterates the data related to pokemons in the pokemonList, in variable "x".

	e) Providing another "for" condition where it iterates the data related to pokemon's next_evolution in pokemonList,
	   in variable "y".

	f) "If" condition holds the logic, which compares if the searched pokemon name is equal to the one present in the
	   the "next_evolution" field in the pokemonList. If its TRUE, then it will provide the pokemon's names.

	g) Provided another if condition to provide a message when the given name is not found in pokemonList.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Find the pokemons that have the given weakness name:

	a) Created a function naming "pokemonWeakness" and provided parameters "weakness" and "pokemonList".

	b) Created a variable "similarPokemonWeakness" and assigned to false. If the "similarPokemonWeakness" is true, then
	   the pokemon name having the given weakness in the "weaknesses" field will be displayed. As of now, its empty.

	c) Created a variable "weakness" so that whatever the weakness is given, it will consider as an argument
	   which will be taken from window.prompt.

	d) Providing a "for" condition where it iterates the data related to pokemon in the pokemonList, in variable "x".

	e) Providing another "for" condition where it iterates the data related to pokemon's weaknesses in pokemonList,
	   in variable "y".

	f) "If" condition holds the logic, which compares if the searched weakness is equal to the one present in the
	   the "weaknesses" field in the pokemonList. If its TRUE, then it will provide the pokemon's names.

	g) Provided another if condition to provide a message when the given weakness is not found in pokemonList.
